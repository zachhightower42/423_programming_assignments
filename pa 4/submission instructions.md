Submit electronically in one package (zip file) to the corresponding assignment given in the
Assignments section by the due date. The package should include the source code and a readme
file that clearly explains what each file within the package is for, how to compile and run
the code and what result would be expected.

NOTE1: all the programming assignments and project should use C programming on Linux.
No other Operating Systems such as Windows and MacOS are accepted. The appendix at the end
of this subsection provides how to use Virtual Machines to build Linux environment for C programming. 
 
NOTE2: all submissions are due at 11:59 pm on the due date. No late submission is accepted.

NOTE3: in all your programming assignments and project, if examples are given,
 you are required to follow the input/output text formatting given in the examples,
  which will count for certain amount of points towards your assignment grade.

NOTE4: if there are multiple parts in the assignment, the source code for each part
 should be submitted (NOT just the source code for the last part), so that if there is
  something wrong in later part, you can still get the points for earlier part.
