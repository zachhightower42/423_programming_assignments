CSCI423/501 Programming Assignment 2 
 
The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any positive integer n 
and apply the following algorithm: 
 
if n is even n/2
if n is odd 3*n+1
 
The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied, all positive 
integers will eventually reach 1. For example, if n=35, the sequence is 
 
35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 
 
Write a C program using the fork() system call that generates this sequence in the 
child process. The starting number will be provided from the command line. For 
example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on the command line, the child process will 
output 8, 4, 2, 1. Have the parent invoke the wait() call to wait for the child process 
to complete before exiting the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure 
that a positive integer is passed on the command line. Following are some running 
examples, assuming the compiled program named b.out: 
 
Example 1: 
 
./b.out 3 
3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 
 
Example 2: 
 
./b.out -3 
<starting value> should be a positive integer 
 
Example 3: 
 
./b.out 
Usage: ./b.out <starting value> 
 
Example 4: 
 
./b.out 3 10 
Usage: ./b.out <starting value>

if n is odd
